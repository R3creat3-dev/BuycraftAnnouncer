OresomeDonor
============

Simple plugin used for announcing new donors on OresomeCraft!

An extremely simple plugin made for the above purpose. Feel free to take and edit this code for use on your own server!
The commands in this plugin are executed by Buycraft when someone buys a package. If you you manually process donations you should just set up a simple CommandHelper script (See https://github.com/Zachoz/CommandHelperStuff).
